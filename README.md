# PetFinal
Final project for my 2020 C# class at BPCC

The goal was to have a selection of virtual pets that would have different stats such has hunger that would change based on user input and time.
We needed to haave each of these stats be track and able to be adjusted, so if you play with your pet voa the button then the hunger would increse and the bordom would decrese.
We also needed to have different pets, and each pet needed tp have different predetermined stats, for example a dog would be more hungry than a bird.
I implimented a couple of types of object oriented priciples into the project such as inheritance and interfaces whre applicable.
